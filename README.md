## Capcut Subtitle Extractor

This is a very simple Python program that takes in [CapCut](https://www.capcut.com/) video projects and returns the subtitles found in the video as SRT files.

The Python code itself is self explanatory in its usage, and at the end, the code will open the result file in File Explorer.

Note that the subtitles must be present in the first text track for this code to work.
